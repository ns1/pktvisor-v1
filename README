This project is a fork of netsniff-ng, available at http://netsniff-ng.org/

It adds a DNS protocol analyzer, which can generate various statistics about real
time traffic streams. It's intended use is to be run on authoritative DNS servers
to diagnose incoming and outgoing DNS traffic.

Like netsniff-ng, it can capture to a pcap. It also includes an ncurses based UI
that provides a top-like interface to live DNS traffic statistics, including traffic
by source/destination IP, DNS query label, result codes, source ports, Geo and ASN.
